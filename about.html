                <h3>How did you make this website?</h3>
                <p>I created it using <span class="highlight_blue">CSS</span>, <span class="highlight_red">HTML</span>, and <span class="highlight_yellow">JavaScript</span>. For the art, (like the cursor) I used LibreSprite.</p>

                <p>Because that's my name, I wanted it to look like you were loading my save files on a video game or something.</p>
